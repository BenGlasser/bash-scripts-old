These two files are various bash scripts I've written [or adjusted] 
for CLI media-related activities. "mcfmod" is a heavy modification 
of a last.fm mpd player which allows a user to play specific 
songs, artists, genres, or songs via mpd and the command line. 
"mcf --help" details syntax. The script as I have it now will 
download and label a single mp3 file from a specified genre, 
artist, or etc. The script depends on id3, xmlstarlet, and misc.
other the standard GNU-linux tools. "youtubedl" is a fairly short 
bash script which, given a youtube URL, provides an mplayer-able or
wget'able download URL. While this is definitely not the shortest 
of youtube download scripts, it is extremely readable and sends 
the minimum required information to the youtube servers. This
script can be used as a basis for other, similar scripts.
